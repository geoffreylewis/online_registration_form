# Techdegree Project 3: Online Registration Form

## Software Summary

I eyed a website mockup at different sizes (provided by Team Treehouse) and programmed it from scratch.  It is programmed as mobile-first, and then there are two media queries that adjust for screen sizes 768px and 1024px so the web page can fit mobiles phones, tablets, and laptops/desktops comfortably.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Additional Notes

* All of the code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.
* I didn't add all 50 states to the select dropdown menu on purpose.
* The rubric for this project says the name attributes for the checkboxes should be identical, but that wouldn't let you select more than one at the same time (which I thought was the point); I left the name attributes unique instead, but I can change it if necessary.

I'd like to thank Team Treehouse for providing another great project idea through their "Front End Web Development" techdegree.  This whole process has been an extremely valuable learning experience for me.
