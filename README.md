# Techdegree Project 3: Online Registration Form

## Software Summary

I built a mobile-first registration form that includes multiple form elements and attributes including <input>, <label>, <select>, and <option>.  I also included a media query to account for screen sizes 768px and larger in size.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Additional Notes

* All of the code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.
* I didn't add all 50 states to the select dropdown menu on purpose.
* The rubric for this project says the name attributes for the checkboxes should be identical, but that wouldn't let you select more than one at the same time (which I thought was the point); I left the name attributes unique instead, but I can change it if necessary.
