# Online Registration Form

## Software Summary

I built a mobile-first registration form (from a mockup provided by Team Treehouse) that includes multiple form elements and attributes including input, label, select, and option.  I also included a media query to account for screen sizes 768px and larger in size.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Version History

**Version 1.0**  
*1/12/2018*  
* All of the code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.
* I didn't add all 50 states to the select dropdown menu on purpose.
* The rubric for this project says the name attributes for the checkboxes should be identical, but that wouldn't let you select more than one at the same time (which I thought was the point since it says plural "newsletters"); I left the name attributes unique instead, but I can change it if necessary.

I'd like to thank Team Treehouse for providing another great project idea through their "Front End Web Development" techdegree.  This whole process has been an extremely valuable learning experience for me.
